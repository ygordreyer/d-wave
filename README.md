# d-wave
Repository that uses D-Wave Ocean SDK for solving the HBD with 2 different methods.
The HBD is an Hypothesis that represents a simple implementation of the finite difference method in the Electrical Impedance Tomography.
HBD was made in a way that makes it possible to execute this section of the EIT in a quantum computer.
